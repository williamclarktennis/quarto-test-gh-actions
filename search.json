What do I select on the Github pages page? Do I select publish with github action or do I select publish with gh-pages (i.e. publish with a branch)? What happens when running quarto publish gh-pages without selecting github pages publish from branch?\nSo I will edit this file, then I will add and commit, then I will push to origin, and hopefully, without the github action will republish my website. If it doesn’t work, I will try adding my github workflows to git."
