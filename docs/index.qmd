This is a Quarto website.

To learn more about Quarto websites visit <https://quarto.org/docs/websites>.

Here is how I think this will work. 
Set up .gitignore file. 
What do I select on the Github pages page? 
Do I select publish with github action 
or do I select publish with gh-pages (i.e. publish 
with a branch)? What happens when running 
quarto publish gh-pages without selecting 
github pages publish from branch?

So I will edit this file, then I will 
add and commit, then I will push to origin, 
and hopefully, without the github action will
republish my website. If it doesn't work, 
I will try adding my github workflows to git.
